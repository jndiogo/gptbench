# Projects

Examples are available as plain Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks:

- [add](add/): Can the model learn how to add two 2 digit numbers? How well will it generalize for unseen sequences?
- [roman](roman/): Train a transformer model to convert decimal numbers to/from roman numerals, ex: 56=LVI or IC=99
- [sequence](sequence/): Can a relatively small model complete number sequences like 1,2,3?
- [continue](continue/): Complete English text directly from a pretrained GPT2 checkpoint or training a model from scratch

Directory [data](data/) contains data files loaded into the datasets. Some data is generated/downloaded by scripts at [dataprep](dataprep/).
